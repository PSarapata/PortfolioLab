## PORTFOLIO LAB ##
This project is part of the premium package of Coders Lab bootcamp. The idea is very similar to Zaplanuj Jedzonko, diet management app you might have had a chance to see. This time though, all the work is done solely by me.

I was given the schematics (HTML shells with custom css styles & a JS script) and have to expand the functionality for the app, that is create models, views and business logics.
